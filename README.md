## Overview

The Zomato Data Analysis Project is a comprehensive study of restaurant data from Zomato. It aims to answer key business questions, including:
- Which restaurant types are most popular?
- How do votes vary by restaurant type?
- What are the most common ratings given by customers?
- How much do couples typically spend on food?
- Do online orders receive higher ratings than offline orders?
- Which restaurant types receive more offline orders?

| `rate`               | Customer rating (out of 5)                           |
| `votes`              | Number of customer votes                             |
| `cost_for_two`       | Approximate cost for two people (in local currency)  |

## Analysis and Insights

The project performs the following key analyses:

1. **Restaurant Type Distribution**: Identifies the most common restaurant types using bar charts.
2. **Votes by Restaurant Type**: Summarizes customer engagement through a line graph of votes by type.
3. **Rating Distribution**: Visualizes the spread of customer ratings through histograms.
4. **Average Spending by Couples**: Examines spending trends and preferences of couples.
5. **Online vs Offline Ratings**: Compares customer ratings for online and offline orders using box plots.
6. **Offline Order Trends**: Highlights restaurant types receiving more offline orders through heatmaps.

## Results

The analysis revealed several actionable insights:

- **Dining restaurants** dominate the platform, receiving the highest votes and orders.
- The majority of restaurants are rated between **3.5 to 4** stars.
- Couples typically spend around **â‚¹300** on average.
- **Online orders** tend to receive better ratings compared to offline orders.
- Offline orders are more prevalent in dining-type restaurants, suggesting an opportunity for targeted promotions.
